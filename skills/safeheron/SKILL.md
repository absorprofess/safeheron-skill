# Safeheron API Skill

A complete reference and integration guide for the Safeheron API and SDKs.

**When NOT to use:** For generic blockchain/Web3 questions unrelated to Safeheron's API or SDK; for other MPC custody providers.

## 🚀 New Here? Start with the Getting Started Guide

**→ `references/{lang}/GETTING_STARTED.md`** (replace `{lang}` with `java`, `js`, `go`, or `python`)

Covers all 5 onboarding steps:
1. Generate RSA key pair
2. Configure API account in Safeheron Console
3. Add SDK to project dependencies
4. Configure environment & inject credentials
5. First API request

## 🔐 Security-First: Mandatory Checklist Before Writing Any Code

**These security principles are non-negotiable and must be reflected in all generated code. Use TaskCreate to create one task per item below before writing ANY code — including bulk "generate all features" requests. Items that are N/A must state a reason; they cannot be silently omitted. When user requests involve credentials, transfers, Webhooks, Co-Signer, or deployment, proactively explain the applicable requirements without waiting to be asked.**

### Credential & Key Management
- [ ] **Credential injection** — Always load API keys, RSA private keys, and platform public keys from a secrets manager. Never hardcode them in source code or config files.
- [ ] **Use the right secrets manager for the deployment target** — AWS KMS or GCP KMS for cloud deployments; HashiCorp Vault for self-hosted; a file outside the project directory (never committed to git) for local development only.

### Transfer & Whitelist Security
- [ ] **`customerRefId` first** — Generate and persist `customerRefId` to your DB **before** calling any Safeheron create API. On timeout, retry with the same ID. Error `9001` = already exists, query instead of recreating.
- [ ] **Whitelist addresses for formal transfers** — `ONE_TIME_ADDRESS` must only be used for genuinely temporary, one-off payments. All recurring or formal transfers (exchange hot wallets, partner addresses, internal accounts) require a whitelisted address.
- [ ] **AML check before every transfer** — Call the Tools API to screen the destination address before creating any outbound transaction. Intercept or alert on high-risk addresses.
- [ ] **Validate address format** — Call the coin address validation endpoint before adding an address to the whitelist or initiating a transfer. Never trust user-supplied address strings directly.
- [ ] **Amounts: String in API, decimal type in code** — Never use `float` or `double` for monetary values. API request fields use `String`; application-side calculations use an arbitrary-precision decimal type (Java: `BigDecimal`; Python: `Decimal`; JS/TS: keep as `string` or use `decimal.js`; Go: `string` or `shopspring/decimal`).
- [ ] **`failOnAml: true` by default** — Only disable when the business case is explicitly confirmed.
- [ ] **`failOnContract: true` by default** — Block contract address destinations unless explicitly required.

### Co-Signer Approval Callback
- [ ] **No blind approval** — The Co-Signer callback service must validate every transaction against the business system before returning `APPROVE`: verify that `customerRefId` matches a real pending order, that the amount matches, and that the destination address matches.
- [ ] **Co-Signer host in private network** — The Co-Signer must be deployed in a private isolated network with no public internet inbound access. The Approval Callback Service must only accept traffic from the Co-Signer host IP.
- [ ] **Production Co-Signer API Key must have Callback configured** — Never skip Callback URL configuration for a Co-Signer API Key in production.

### Webhook Security
- [ ] **Webhook signature verification** — Every webhook payload must have its `sig` verified using Safeheron's RSA public key before any processing. Reject events with invalid signatures immediately.
- [ ] **Webhook must use HTTPS** — Never expose an HTTP webhook endpoint in production.
- [ ] **Webhook handlers must be idempotent** — Safeheron retries up to 7 times. Never double-credit a deposit or double-process a withdrawal on duplicate events.
- [ ] **No status rollback; terminal state wins** — If the current DB status is already `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`,`CANCELLED`, or `REJECTED`, discard any later-arriving event for that transaction — even if it carries an intermediate status (out-of-order delivery is possible).
- [ ] **Webhook IP whitelist** — Only accept webhook traffic from Safeheron's egress IPs: `18.162.105.64`, `18.167.22.59`, `18.167.21.182`
- [ ] **Webhook + REST API polling** — Always implement both: Webhook as primary, REST API polling as fallback. Call `/v1/transactions/one` periodically to re-request failed deliveries.

### Policy & Operational Alerts
- [ ] **Policy: least privilege** — API Keys, approval policies, and server permissions must be scoped to the minimum required.
- [ ] **Catch-all blocking policy** — Add a "block all" rule at the bottom of the policy stack to intercept transactions that match no defined rule.
- [ ] **Subscribe to operational alerts** — Always subscribe to `ILLEGAL_IP_REQUEST`, `NO_MATCHING_TRANSACTION_POLICY`,`GAS_BALANCE_WARNING`, and `AML_KYT_ALERT` webhook events.
- [ ] **Minimum deposit filter** — Filter dust/address-pollution deposits by enforcing a minimum deposit amount in your system.

## ⚠️ SDK Initialization Pattern (Per Language)

| Language | Config | Get API instance | Invoke |
|----------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Java | `SafeheronConfig` builder | `ServiceCreator.create(XxxApiService.class, config)` | `ServiceExecutor.execute(...)` sync |
| JS/TS | config object `{ baseUrl, apiKey, rsaPrivateKey, safeheronRsaPublicKey }` | `new XxxApi(config)` | `async/await` |
| Python | config dict `{ 'apiKey', 'privateKey', 'safeheronPublicKey', 'baseUrl' }` | `XxxApi(config)` | sync method call |
| Go | `safeheron.ApiConfig{ BaseUrl, ApiKey, RsaPrivateKey, SafeheronRsaPublicKey }` | `api.XxxApi{Client: sc}` | sync, returns `error` |

## Important Notes

- **IP Whitelisting** is mandatory — register your server IP in Safeheron Console first. API calls from unregistered IPs are rejected.
- **Idempotency** — generate `customerRefId` (UUID) and **save to DB before calling Safeheron**. On timeout, retry with the same ID. Error `9001` = duplicate refId (query existing instead of creating new).
- All monetary amounts are **strings** — never use float/double.
- **Web3 API** requires a Web3 wallet. Using a Vault account key causes "account not found".
- **MPC Sign** requires a special policy — contact Safeheron Support to enable (error `9028` = policy not configured).
- SDK is **backward compatible** — upgrading only adds new methods, never removes old ones.
